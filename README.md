# Welcome to "Star-Match" Game! 

The project is a logic game that shows a random quantity from stars and the player needs to select the number(s) according to the numbers of stars showed. Example:

   :star: :star: :star:   = (1 + 2) or (3)
   

**Another Example:**
   
   :star: :star: :star: :star: :star:  = (3 + 2) or (4 + 1) or (5)


The proposal is select all numbers in 10 seconds according to stars numbers showed.
